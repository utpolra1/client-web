# Full-Stack MERN Product Search and Filtering Website

This project is a single-page web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The application allows users to browse and filter products using various criteria such as category, price range, and brand name. It also supports pagination, sorting, and search functionality. The app includes user authentication via Google and Email/Password through Firebase. The website is fully responsive with a mobile-first design approach.

## Features

- **Pagination:** Efficiently loads products with pagination support.
- **Search:** Users can search for products by name.
- **Categorization:** Products can be filtered by brand name, category name, and price range.
- **Sorting:** Products can be sorted by price (low to high, high to low) and by the date added (newest first).
- **Authentication:** Supports Google authentication and Email/Password authentication via Firebase.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is mobile-first and responsive across all devices.
- **Fixed-size Product Cards:** Displays product information concisely in fixed-size cards.
- **Navbar and Footer:** Includes a Navbar with the website name/logo and relevant routes, as well as a Footer with necessary information and links.
